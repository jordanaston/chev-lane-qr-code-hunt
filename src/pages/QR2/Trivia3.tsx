          Some brands highlight eco-friendly aspects of their business while
          downplaying their harmful aspects, resulting in a deceptive overall
          image. <br />
          <br />
          This often diverts attention from negative aspects, like energy-usage
          or large-scale production through the marketing of a supposedly
          sustainable product.
          <br />
          <br />
          Several well-known brands have faced accusations of green-washing. For
          instance, in 2011, H&M faced criticism for its Conscious Collection
          while their overall environmental impact remained high.
