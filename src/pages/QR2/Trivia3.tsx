          Often brands highlight eco-friendly aspects of their business while
          downplaying their overall harmful aspects, resulting in a misleading
          overall image. <br />
          <br />
          Many well-known brands, like H&M, in 2011 have been accused of
          greenwashing - where their sustainable efforts were contradicted by
          their large overall impact.
          <br />
          <br />
          Luckily regulations are being imposed against greenwashing to promote
          transparency and accountability in business practices.
